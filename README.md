Hey there, I'm Madalyn Villanueva, or Madalyn Hedges. 
I was assigned to create a project the included a search bar for a giph website. I made it as simple as I could get it to be since, I will admit, I struggled with this project. The search bar is in the center and all you have to do is search up a word, or phrase, and giphs would load on your screen.
I used HTML, CSS, and JS. I did try to use SCSS, but decided I wouldn't have made made good progress or a good enough website since it would've been my first time using it.
There are LOTS of ideas for improvement- For example, The search bar likes to go to the left side of the screen when you click search.
The title of the page wouldn't center itself to the top and would remainded in the background.
Some of the gifs are cut off when they load on the screen; I would try to adjust margins and deminsions, but nothing worked.
The title (or header in the case) would not become transparent so that the background motion effect would flow fluidly.
I based the majority of my code in HTML and used JS to help with designing the page's aesthetics. I didn't do use JS in my last project, and I was eager to try it out to see what is possible. (I enjoy being creative.)
Javascript is something I need to improve on- But it's got to start somewhere, so here's my best shot.
